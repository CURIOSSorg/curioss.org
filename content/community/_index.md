        <p>The center of CURIOSS is our working groups - recurring meetings where we share how we’re building open source program offices (CURIOSSs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other’s efforts.
        </p>
        <p>Over the past two years, we’ve held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of CURIOSSs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.
