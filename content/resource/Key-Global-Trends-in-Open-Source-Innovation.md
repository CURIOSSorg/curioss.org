Visible endorsement and support of open source has grown in recent years across all levels of research, government and industry. 

At the recent ‘Open Source Innovation in Universities’ event, [CURIOSS](https://CURIOSS.org/) Community Organizer and [Innersource Commons Foundation](https://innersourcecommons.org/) Executive Director, Clare Dillon, discussed the current trends driving open source innovation. 

In her talk, Dillon explored the maturing field of open source, its impact beyond software, and the key drivers influencing the open source landscape.

## Open source has matured

Open source code underpins the majority of technology in use today at a global level. Alongside the expansion of open source, a deeper understanding of open source has emerged, leading to widespread agreement that open source “... is not just code.”

“Open source can also mean the … tools, processes and culture built around software to enable it to process and deal with contributions from the community,” said Dillon. “In the last number of years, these ways of working have very much matured – so when you think about mature, responsible open source, there are a lot of people doing this in a very professionalized way.”

One important example is open source hardware. From computers and electronics to machine tooling and medical devices, more open source hardware projects are being made available through the open-design movement – marking a clear progression from open source code to open source culture. Importantly, the Free and Open Source Hardware community (FOSH) maintains that using an open source license is insufficient - for a project to be open source, it must follow the principles of open source, such as modular design or community collaboration. 

Open source hardware has emerged as a crucial field with innovations like 3D printing enabling the replication of various hardware designs around the world. This diversification confirms that open source is no longer confined to one domain but spans a range of diverse industries.

## Essential benefits of open source

There is also a greater understanding of the economic value inherent in an open approach to research and innovation. More than any earnings from licensing or commercial distribution; real value and savings can be realized when organizations, universities and companies invest in and use open source.

Several of these benefits have directly contributed to the maturity of open source - both as a technology and as a movement:

- <b>Code reuse</b>: Modern technology demands complex stacks, and code reuse through open source has become essential to avoid duplicating efforts and resources.

- <b>Accelerated Innovation</b>: Open source fosters rapid innovation, as new developments can be shared and built upon by a global community.

- <b>Pooled Resources</b>: Collaborative open source projects pool resources, leading to greater efficiency and shared expertise.

- <b>Shared Risk</b>: Open source's collective nature ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed collaboratively, enhancing overall security.

- <b>Rise of Commercial Open Source</b>: Companies are increasingly building their business models around open source projects, demonstrating its viability as a revenue stream.

- <b>Increased Trust</b>: As technology influences more aspects of daily life, open source's transparent and trust-based model has become essential for building public trust.

## Trends shaping our open future
Growing acceptance of open source as integral to existing and future development is expanding possibilities for companies and institutions. Dillon’s talk identified the key trends currently shaping open source, open science, and also innovation around the globe.

### Open Source's Ubiquity

Open source has not only become a prevalent force in the technology industry but has also extended its reach to impact various sectors of society. The reality is that open source is everywhere, influencing how we live and work. Dillon noted that approximately 96% of the world's top million servers and 90% of all cloud infrastructure run on open source software. These figures illustrate the critical role open source plays in powering the digital landscape.

Moreover, open source is no longer limited to software, with the emergence of other open fields such as open source hardware playing equally significant roles. Dillon referenced [the robotics leg developed by the University of Michigan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUzxJCmo5v4&t=11s), showcasing how hardware innovations are being shared through open source schematics that enable replication and adaptation. The expansion of open source into new fields further highlights the maturation and diversification of open source.

### Accelerated Innovation and Collaboration

Open source's ability to foster accelerated innovation is a cornerstone of its evolution. When projects are shared openly, developers from around the world can contribute and build upon existing solutions. As a result, open source communities become hubs of creative collaboration, often leading to the establishment of industry standards.

Dillon spoke of the concept of "pooled resources," where various entities (including corporations) collaborate on open source projects to solve common challenges. This pooling of resources not only increases efficiency but also allows organizations to share the risks associated with complex projects. In the fast-paced world of technology, open source communities enable quick advancements and maintain relevance.

### Open Source's Economic and Social Impact

Open source's economic impact is undeniable. Businesses and organizations worldwide have recognized that adopting open source solutions can drive cost-efficiency, innovation and competitiveness. The emergence of commercial open source companies is a testament to the viability of open source as a sustainable business model. Companies are now building successful ventures on the back of open source projects.

Beyond economic benefits, open source has a profound social impact. As technology increasingly shapes society, ensuring trust and transparency in the technology we rely on is paramount. Open source's collaborative nature allows for greater transparency, accountability and inclusivity. The creation of [digital public goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) is an example of how open source contributes to tackling global challenges and promoting equitable solutions.

### Policy Shifts and Open Source Support

Governments and institutions have begun to recognize the importance of open source and its potential for driving positive change. Dillon referenced the event’s keynote from Sachiko Muto, Chair of [OpenForum Europe](https://openforumeurope.org/), which walked through the emergence of policies aimed at promoting open source adoption. From the European Commission to the White House and beyond, these policies seek to create both economic and societal benefits while emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open innovation to address shared challenges.

## A progressively permanent shift

Dillon’s talk on open source trends and evolution shed light on the paradigm shift in perceptions and realities surrounding open source. It is no longer limited to a few developers working in isolation; instead, open source has become a global phenomenon with diverse applications across industries. 

The maturation of open source, its economic and social impact, and emerging policies in its favor all indicate that it will continue to shape the future of technology and beyond. Embracing the principles of open source is not just about adopting a particular software development approach; it is about joining a vibrant, diverse community that is dedicated to creating a better, more inclusive, and sustainable future for all.
