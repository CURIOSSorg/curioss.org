Trinity College Dublin’s (TCD) CURIOSS was launched in 2020. The office is a division of Trinity Innovation within the university.

The CURIOSS <b>promotes and supports</b> the principles of <b>open source</b> and <b>open data</b> in <b>knowledge transfer</b> and <b>industry engagement</b> for TCD researchers.

It also recognizes that open source access to knowledge and intellectual property is not limited to software and data but also applies to hardware and other intellectual assets.

The CURIOSS’s primary function is the empowerment of researchers to execute on their open source and open data strategies. Core activities include:

- Liaising with external stakeholders and creating partnerships to enable TCD’s academic community to engage in research commercialization, technology transfer, and to affect social change.
- Supporting open source and open data strategies amongst campus companies.
- Promoting knowledge transfer.
- Provision of advice and guidance on open source licenses and alignment with funding conditions.
- Issue of template agreements for engagement with industry partners.
