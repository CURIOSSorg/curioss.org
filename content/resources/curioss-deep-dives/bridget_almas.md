Every month, we invite an expert in the field of open science, open research or academic open source to speak to CURIOSS [members](https://curioss.org/about/members/) and participate in a Q&A session under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule).

We share recordings from our monthly Deep Dive presentations to support knowledge exchange and accelerate the advancement of academic open source throughout the ecosystem.
