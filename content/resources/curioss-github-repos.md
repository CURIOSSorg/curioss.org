We value sharing knowledge and promoting collaboration with everyone involved in academic open source within the ecosystem.

Connect with us on GitHub to follow and use our co-created community resources.

Your experience in academic open source matters! Open an issue or create a PR so that we can learn from you!


## Check out our GitHub repos:
Follow our [CURIOSS GitHub account](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg) to keep track of our resources.

Read and add your learning of what works in your institutions to our [CURIOSS Patterns repo](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg/curioss-patterns).

The [Job Descriptions repo](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg/job-descriptions) is a place where academic OSPOs can share templates for job descriptions.

The [CURIOSS OSPO Definition Working Group repo](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg/ospo-definition-WG) collaborated to create this [definition of an Academic OSPO](https://zenodo.org/records/13910683). This resource is for anyone who wants to understand, explain or promote an OSPO in their institution.
