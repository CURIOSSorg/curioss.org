When someone finds a great solution, we want everyone to benefit from it!

One of our main goals at CURIOSS is to empower our [members](https://curioss.org/about/members/) to share learning about how OSPOs at different universities and research institutions successfully tackle common challenges.

Our patterns collection serves as a community-curated repository of proven solutions for academic OSPOs. Through these patterns, members share valuable insights based on their unique contexts in a way that allows others to adapt successful approaches for their own institutions.
         
## What Are Patterns?
Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems within a specific context.

They offer a flexible blueprint or a 'recipe' on what works to solve a particular problem.

Patterns relate to common problems but they aren't one-size-fits-all solutions. A key feature of patterns are that they can be modified to fit different circumstances, constraints and culture.

The [concept of patterns](https://softwarepatternslexicon.com/patterns-lua/1/3/) originates from the architecture and urban design in the work of Christopher Alexander. They were later adapted for software engineering, organizational design, and beyond.


## Acknowledgements

We thank all our members who have generously contributed to this body of knowledge about academic OSPOs.

The CURIOSS Patterns Practice is based on the [InnerSource Commons Patterns Practice](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/) and we are grateful to everyone in the InnerSource Commons community for inspiring us in this effort.
