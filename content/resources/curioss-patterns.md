## What Are Patterns?
Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems within a specific context.

They offer a flexible blueprint or a 'recipe' on what works to solve a particular problem.

Patterns relate to common problems but they aren't one-size-fits-all solutions. A key feature of patterns are that they can be modified to fit different circumstances, constraints and culture.

The [concept of patterns](https://softwarepatternslexicon.com/patterns-lua/1/3/) originates from the architecture and urban design in the work of Christopher Alexander. They were later adapted for software engineering, organizational design, and beyond.


## More about CURIOSS Patterns
When someone finds a great solution, we want everyone to benefit from it!

One of our main goals at CURIOSS is to help our [members](https://curioss.org/about/members/) share learning about how OSPOs at different universities and research institutions successfully tackle common challenges.

In these patterns, our members also share learning about the process or results based on their specific context.

## Acknowledgements

We thank all our members who have generously contributed to this body of knowledge about academic OSPOs.

The CURIOSS Patterns Practice is based on the [InnerSource Commons Patterns Practice](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/) and we are grateful to everyone in the InnerSource Commons community for inspiring us in this effort.
