CURIOSS is a community for those working in University and Research Institution OSPOs. Our goals are to facilitate the networking and collaboration between OSPO representatives from universities and research institutions worldwide.

CURIOSS was set up in 2023 with the support of a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

## FAQs


<b>I am an OSS advocate in my university, but we don’t have an OSPO, can I join CURIOSS? </b>

This community is designed exclusively for OSPO representatives, or those actively involved in setting up an OSPO in a university or research institution. 

<b>I work in an associated community, foundation, or corporate organization that supports OSPOs, can I join?</b> 

From time to time, CURIOSS may invite representatives from associated communities, foundations, or corporate organizations to join specific conversations or CURIOSS project groups. However, to ensure we keep the community focused and continue to provide a safe space for discussion, such individuals will not become CURIOSS members.

<b>How will CURIOSS work with other related communities and organizations?</b>

CURIOSS was set up to meet the need for a safe space dedicated to those in OSPOs in universities and research institutions. We acknowledge that there are many communities out there who are involved in related activities. We aim to keep CURIOSS members informed of the events and activities happening in the broader academic OSS landscape. If you have an event or activity you would like to share with the CURIOSS community, please get email us at: info@curioss.org.
