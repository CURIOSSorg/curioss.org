The 2026 CURIOSS Gathering took place in Dublin from February 5th-6th.

The two day event brought together CURIOSS members working in academic Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), the academic open source community and the wider ecosystem to highlight the impact of open source in academia and to explore the role that OSPOs play as centers of competency for open source software within their institutions.

Day 1 was an exclusive members-only session, welcoming over 30 participants from 20 academic OSPOs to share learning, exchange best practice and engage in critical dialogue about their work. 

Day 2 opened up the conversation to a broader audience spanning academia and the wider open source ecosystem. A series of talks, ‘Ask the Experts’ sessions and open discussions tackled pressing questions about open source in academia today.
