Description: New grant supports the development and growth of CURIOSS
---

The [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) has awarded funding to Clare Dillon and Richard Littauer to develop and expand the work of CURIOSS, the community for university and research institution OSPOs, over the next three years. The award comes after an initial grant from the Sloan Foundation to establish the CURIOSS network in 2023.

The grant will enable CURIOSS to continue supporting the community of individuals working in Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) in academic institutions. CURIOSS goals include creating scalable and replicable patterns for academic OSPO success. By working together, CURIOSS members can share resources and lessons learned, and co-create assets focused on open source in the academic context.

“A year ago, the Sloan Foundation supported the establishment of CURIOSS and they now have a growing worldwide membership”, said Josh Greenberg, Program Director at the Sloan Foundation. “Academic OSPOs play a pivotal role in advancing open source practices, facilitating collaboration, and sharing knowledge across universities and research institutions. CURIOSS brings together those in the academic OSPO community so they can collaborate to scale their impact so we’re delighted to support the CURIOSS leaders in their work to develop and grow the community”.

Dillon and Littauer look forward to using these funds to continue expanding CURIOSS's offerings and to build an even more robust network of collaborators.
