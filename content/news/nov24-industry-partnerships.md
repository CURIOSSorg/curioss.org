# How OSPOs Support Academic-Industry Partnerships

At a recent panel discussion at the Linux Foundation Open Source Summit Europe 2024, titled "[Collaboration with Universities and Enterprises: OSPO \- What's Next?](https://youtu.be/HhlQajqwGYU?feature=shared)", TODO Group members and CURIOSS members shared insights on bridging the gap between academia and industry through Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). 

The panel explored how traditional technology transfer offices in academic institutions are being complemented by Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), creating a new paradigm for research collaboration. This dual approach addresses both conventional commercialization paths and more flexible, open collaboration models, offering new opportunities for knowledge exchange and innovation. As Sayeed Choudhury noted, "Technology transfer offices are typically the way in which universities and industry have interacted with each other, but what is interesting is the OSPO is now becoming another way in which researchers, faculty, and students are thinking about working with industry."

The panel featured Sayeed Choudhury from Carnegie Mellon University, John Whelan from Trinity College Dublin representing academia, alongside Jonas van den Bogaard from Alliander and Natali Vlatko from Cisco providing industry perspectives, with Ana Jimenez from the Linux Foundation moderating the discussion.

# Academic Landscape

Universities manage research outputs from diverse project types. As Sayeed explained, "Universities have large numbers of small projects, ranging from one person to typically no more than half a dozen." This structure presents unique opportunities and challenges for collaboration.

John Whelan from Trinity College Dublin’s OSPO offered a European perspective, focusing on the challenges OSPOs face in being tasked with optimizing commercial impact while researchers may be more motivated with increasing academic freedom. Faculty members increasingly seek ways to maintain influence over their research while engaging with industry, with academic freedom and publication rights remaining fundamental priorities. John emphasized that "Open source is about freedom, academia is about freedom. We're kind of caught in the middle and we're trying to navigate and educate what you can do if you're a researcher."

The ability to initiate open source industry-academic research projects without overly-formal processes creates tremendous opportunities for innovation and collaboration. 

In addition, open source projects offer an alternative pathway for ongoing, sustained engagement with commercialized research outputs. Sayeed noted the trend: “Faculty will often take a year of absence in the United States to launch a company but they almost always come back. It's rare that they want to run the company. They don't want to be the CEO of the company that's been formed but they still want influence.” Take the case where a spin-out business is based on an open source research output. In that scenario, researchers can stay involved in the technical direction of their work as a technical contributor or maintainer role, even if they return to their faculty position. 

# Industry Perspective

Companies like [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) and [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/en/) are discovering strategic advantages in open source collaboration with universities. The approach enables faster adoption of research outcomes through reduced friction in technology transfer, while promoting more efficient resource utilization through shared development. This collaborative model has proven particularly effective in enhancing innovation potential and accelerating research implementation.

Jonas van den Bogaard from Alliander emphasized the strategic importance of open source in innovation: "We see that taking an open source and open access approach to our research activities helps universities use the products and software we develop and apply in industry... and vice versa, enabling us to more easily benefit from research outcomes." In particular, Jonas noted that having open source research outputs allowed Alliander to contribute to the joint research projects to make the software enterprise-ready as research is still in progress \- another reason why Alliander more and more make open source a requirement for joint R\&D activities.  

As a result, Alliander has a number of formal collaborations with leading universities in the Netherlands such as [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2023/powerweb-institute/alliander-and-the-powerweb-institute-strengthen-and-expand-collaborations) and the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) that mandate open source outputs. Through partnerships like these, Alliander and expert researchers will tackle many challenges across a number of domains including: AI for Grid Operations, Modelling and numerical methods, Robotics, and sensors. 

Natali Vlatko from Cisco highlighted how their research collaboration benefits from the open source model: "When the research is put out there, it doesn't take long to spread and get that interest." This natural networking effect enhances collaboration opportunities and accelerates innovation. Natalie pointed out that she works with a large community of internal researchers, fellows and engineers in Cisco Research who are working on state-of-the-art cutting edge areas like cyber security,  AI and machine learning, and Quantum Computing. Open source research allows them to more easily collaborate with researchers in universities on the projects that impact Cisco’s bottom line.  Natalie also highlighted the benefits of the human connections made in open source communities. Through collaborating on open source projects, the Cisco research community has become really well connected with external researchers interested in the same topics, which leads to more collaboration opportunities. 

# Additional Examples 

Looking further afield, members of the CURIOSS community have been involved in similar collaborative projects. For example, the [OSPO at UC Santa Cruz](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/) was formed within the [Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS)](https://cross.ucsc.edu/index.html) and fosters academic-industry collaboration through several key initiatives. CROSS builds on the NSF model for Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) with an incubator that funds postdoctoral fellows to advance their research prototypes into robust open-source projects. The Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) program, now managed by the UCSC OSPO, connects students with mentors and industry sponsors to work on open-source projects, building talent and promoting open-source practices. Projects like these strengthen the bridge between academia and industry, promoting innovation and the practical application of research through open-source collaboration.

# Emerging Collaboration Models

The examples demonstrate how universities and enterprises are developing innovative approaches to collaboration through integrated OSPOs within university structures. Open source projects facilitate new funding models that support open collaboration while ensuring strategic alignment between academic research and industry needs. OSPOs can help foster governance structures that preserve academic freedom while enabling practical commercialization paths.

Success in these collaborations requires careful attention to sustainability planning from project inception. Clear governance structures that preserve academic freedom while enabling practical commercialization have proven essential. The panel emphasized the importance of balanced approaches to IP rights and commercialization that benefit both sectors.

The panel also discussed how OSPOs can also help with project sustainability over time. However, not all open source research output projects may need to be sustained. Natali Vlatko from Cisco noted that: "It's okay for projects to die. In fact, it's really good that they're sunset in a good way, telling the community when there are no more resources." This pragmatic approach to project management helps focus community efforts and resources more effectively.

# Future Implications 

The discussion at LF OSS EU Summit highlighted how OSPOs are reshaping traditional academic-industry partnerships. As John Whelan pointed out, "Open source gets rid of all that hassle about jointly owned IP \- everybody owns it, the world owns it." Collaborators are interested in this approach because it simplifies collaboration and accelerates innovation, while maintaining academic freedom and enabling practical commercialization paths.

Some key considerations for successful collaboration include:

* Balanced approach to IP rights and commercialization  
* Clear governance structures that preserve academic freedom  
* Sustainability planning from project inception

Successful industry-academic collaboration through OSPOs requires careful consideration of both sectors' needs. This collaborative model can significantly transform how universities and industry partners work together, potentially reshaping global innovation landscapes through more efficient and effective knowledge transfer mechanisms.
