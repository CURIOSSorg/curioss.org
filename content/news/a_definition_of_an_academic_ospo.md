Over the last 20 years, Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) have become a relatively common feature in major tech companies and other industries. Many businesses rely upon their OSPOs to manage open source software efforts within their organizations. Industry OSPOs also have other functions including developing guidelines and policies on use of open source; contributing to the open source ecosystem; and ensuring alignment with corporate strategy and vision.

As open source software continues to grow in importance in academic settings; universities and other academic institutions are looking to enhance their open source capabilities by establishing **academic OSPOs**. This article provides a short overview of the current findings of a sub-committee of [CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) members who are collaborating to develop, refine and expand upon the definition of an academic OSPO.

This document is versioned. This is version 1.0. Additions, thoughts, and comments are encouraged! Reach out to [info@curioss.org](mailto:info@curioss.org).


## A basic definition


An academic OSPO is defined as an organizational construct, situated in an academic research institution, supported by one or more individuals that acts as a convener, community steward, and center of competency for open source software.


An academic OSPO may cover some or all of the following: funding and financial support, advocacy and policy, supporting the creation of new OSS by the academic community, community building, tools and infrastructure to support OSS, working with tech transfer and external partners, educational efforts, developing and sharing best practices.


This is explored in more detail below.


## Why does a definition matter?

Open source software is not only a research tool, it is a primary research object in its own right. The broader open source ecosystem, with its emphasis on innovation, knowledge sharing, and amplifying impact, has sparked a sea change in the research landscape. The wider ecosystem in which researchers operate has also created massive opportunities for universities and research institutions to substantially extend their social impact - a primary mission throughout academia.

Open source software has expanded far beyond computer science departments. It has become a valuable tool from the life sciences to humanities. It is continuing to transform the ways research and collaboration are conducted.

However, a deeper understanding of the potential and the risks relating to open source software can vary from one university department to another. 

From the perspective of our working group and other academic OSPOs that we’ve engaged with, it is vital for staff working in academic OSPOs to clearly articulate the office’s significance and its position as the central, primary resource for anyone working with open source software in their institution. Framing open source software and the OSPO within the overall context and mission of the university is also crucial in terms of communicating the need to educate, manage risk and amplify the social impact of open source projects and open source software.

A successful definition of an academic OSPO does not only explain what an OSPO does, it also serves to raise awareness of the importance of open source software within a learning and research environment and it communicates impact.


## Refining the definition and mapping OSPO activities

This work of defining what an OSPO does has been worked on by a working group of OSPO members from Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Saint Louis University, the George Washington University, and UC Santa Cruz.

One particularly useful exercise we’ve undertaken is to map out the various activities that academic OSPOs currently undertake. Just like any central resource in an academic institution, the breadth of activities is wide and diverse and also varies from one institution to another.

The graphic above provides a broad overview of the various activities undertaken by different [CURIOSS members](https://curioss.org/about/members/). The types of work undertaken by different OSPOs will depend on the mission of their university, the resources available and the strategic direction of the service. 

 \
Within each category of work, numerous activities may take place. The types of activities will depend on resources and the strategic direction of the OSPO; not every OSPO is able to support all of the listed activities. The tables below highlight the breadth of activities that are undertaken by various academic OSPOs within their institutions.


## 1. Developing and sharing best practices

A key role for an academic OSPO can be focusing on providing information related to best practices around open sourcing their software and data as well as the required policies on open sourcing for an institution. Many if not all OSPOs provide some advice on open source licensing and work with on-campus tech transfer offices and researchers to help support best practices around open source licensing and release of software and data products.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Developing and sharing best practices</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Provide advice on licensing
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Provide mentoring processes
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Open source policies
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Facilitating open research best practices for OSS researchers
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Create guides (e.g. the Academic OSPO guide)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## 2. Educational efforts

Support for best practices may extend beyond simple guidance for open source licensing guidelines and processes. Many OSPOs support educational efforts through engagement with internship programs like Google Summer of Code, local workshops and tutorials, and mentorship of students. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Educational efforts</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Teach students directly about OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Develop certified curricula
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Support student internships
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Support OSS educational efforts
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Mentoring students (MS, PhD, UG)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Working with Tech Transfer and external partners

The OSPO is the center of excellence within a university most empowered to understand and advise on how open source is used externally, and how to maximize the impact of open source software. As such, they often broker agreements and collaboration both within and outside of the university. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Working with Tech Transfer and external partners</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Translation of academic discovery into products
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Generate societal impact
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Collaborate with industry partners
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Collaborate with non-profits
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Work closely with (or possibly in) tech transfer office and research commercialization
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Issuing template agreements for engagements with industry partners
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Knowledge transfer
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 4. Tools and Infrastructure to support OSS

A critical part of open source software depends upon the unseen infrastructure that can sustain it. The OSPO can be well situated to do this behind the scenes work, enabling innovation.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Tools and Infrastructure to support OSS</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Providing tools and software engineering support for OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Providing administration assistance with grants for OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Support efforts for OSS ed-tech within the university
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Hosting infrastructure
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 5. Community building

Open source software depends upon healthy open source communities. The OSPO can provide resources and infrastructure for communities to thrive, as well as providing guidance on the best way to grow healthy, sustainable, diverse ecosystems of developers.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Community building</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Discover, build, support, university OSS community
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Build and maintain stakeholder groups
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Organizing local conferences and meetups
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Working with Summer of Code
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Collaborate with other OSPOs
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Working within consortia or partner universities on OSS best practices
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Brokering OSS connections through providing a marketplace for sharing OSS projects
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Conference and event hosting
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Curation of OSS software through the institution
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 6. Support the creation of new OSS by the academic community

Providing support for OSS through the OSPO can involve helping researchers understand what OSS can do for them and how to maximize its impact, but could also be more hands on, involving working directly with maintainers, developers, or research software engineers to build better OSS.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Support the creation of new OSS by the academic community</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Explore OSS for science
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Research which uses OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Developing OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Consulting for OSS projects
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Work with RSEs who develop/maintain OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 7. Advocacy and Policy

The OSPO is part of the university - which means it is their role to help raise the voice of developers and OSS communities that otherwise wouldn't be able to be heard. This can involve advocating either locally within the institution, to external partners, or to the wider world.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Advocacy and Policy</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Advising faculty and senior leadership on OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Advising on security and dependency management
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Policy recommendations and best practices around OSS AI
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Representing OSS work at universities to lawmakers
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Advocating for open science practices
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Building awareness of value and impact of OSS
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Supporting open data initiatives and open work in general
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 8.Funding and financial support

OSS, including academic open source that underpins our collective global digital infrastructure, is critically underfunded in the vast majority of cases. Navigating funding is one of the roles of the OSPO, as most developers are not adept with financial systems, grant writing, or how to raise awareness of their work.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Funding and financial support</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Supporting grant applications and grant writing
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Grant execution as PIs or senior personnel
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Grant compliance with respect to OSS requirements
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Partnering with Industry Sponsors
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Fellowships or Student Awards for OSS development
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Paying maintainers of OSS projects
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Conclusion

Defining the academic OSPO is critical for articulating the value of its service and also for making the case for stewarding open source software in today’s research landscape. As our working group has explored the definition, the diverse range of activities taking place under the auspices of academic OSPOs has certainly demonstrated that the scope and responsibilities of OSPOs is as varied as the research landscape itself and also reflect the needs for support from various stakeholders in the academic setting.
