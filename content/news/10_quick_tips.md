Description: New preprint on software resiliency
---

A new preprint, [10 quick tips for making your software outlive your job](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484), offers essential guidance for researchers and developers concerned with the longevity of their software projects. The paper addresses a pervasive challenge in academic and research environments: how to ensure valuable software tools remain functional and accessible after their original creators move on to new positions or projects. The guide is particularly timely as shifts in funding and organizational priorities are potentially impacting the continuity of valuable software resources.

Each tip comes with concrete implementation steps, making the resource immediately useful for research software practitioners at any career stage.

The preprint informs the work of the [Succession Planning for Research Software Task Force](https://www.researchsoft.org/tf-succession-planning/), co-run by CURIOSS and [ReSA](https://www.researchsoft.org/), which aims to develop a best practices guide for responsibly wrapping up research code when individuals leave their institutions. Drawing on the preprint's findings, the task force will address common challenges faced across the international research software community. By gathering community feedback and creating an easy-to-use checklist based on the preprint's recommendations, the group seeks to support sustainable transitions and long-term preservation of software projects. Outputs will include a GitHub repository or Jupyter Notebook and markdown-based checklists, all shared under a CC-BY 4.0 license.
