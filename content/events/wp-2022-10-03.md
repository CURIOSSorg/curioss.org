This workshop is a follow-up to the Sep 22nd CURIOSS Community Call on Skills and Education. Clare presented a summary of the findings from Ireland on the Open Source Skills Gap and one of the recommendations was to compile a list of known educational resources. 


This workshop explored aspects such as what resources would be useful and how we might go about compiling such a list of resources.
