This special 2 hour CURIOSS Workshop happened live from Paris as part the in-person Paris Open Source Global Forum (Nov 8) and at the start of the Paris Open Source Experience (Nov 9 & 10).

Three Institutions, Two CURIOSSs, and Shared Policy Goals:

- [City of Paris, France](https://opensource.paris.fr/ossparis/)
- [Johns Hopkins University](https://drcc.library.jhu.edu/open-source-programs-office/)

We brought together perspectives on institutional-to-institution cooperation from politicians, academics, and community leaders, while showcasing a real-world case-study of Open Source and Policy Cooperation.
