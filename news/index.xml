&lt;p&gt;Across universities, academic OSPOs are increasingly being approached by faculty seeking support with funding applications. Recent conversations amongst &lt;a href="https://curioss.org/about/members/"&gt;CURIOSS members&lt;/a&gt; have revealed how these requests present unique opportunities - not just to help secure research funding but to build open source best practices into projects from their earliest stages.
These experiences have informed new &lt;a href="https://curioss.org/resources/curioss-patterns/"&gt;CURIOSS patterns&lt;/a&gt; that capture proven approaches for both assisting with and leading on grant applications. The patterns highlight how this work consistently delivers multiple benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Academic OSPOs leverage events to deepen Open Source engagement</title><link>https://curioss.org/news/2025-02-17-how_academic_ospos_leverage_events/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://curioss.org/news/2025-02-17-how_academic_ospos_leverage_events/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://curioss.org/about/members/"&gt;CURIOSS members&lt;/a&gt; have collaborated to identify several key &lt;a href="https://curioss.org/resources/curioss-patterns/"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrate how academic OSPOs leverage events and conferences to develop stronger open source communities and open source practices; and to advocate for open source software as an important research artifact within their universities and research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CURIOSS at UN Open Source Week</title><link>https://curioss.org/news/un_open_source_week/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://curioss.org/news/un_open_source_week/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

The paper addresses a pervasive challenge in academic and research environments: how to ensure valuable software tools remain functional and accessible after their original creators move on to new positions or projects. The guide is particularly timely as shifts in funding and organizational priorities are potentially impacting the continuity of valuable software resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Academic Open Source Workshop at CHAOSSCon Europe 2025</title><link>https://curioss.org/news/2025-02-27-academic-open-source-workshop-chaosscon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://curioss.org/news/2025-02-27-academic-open-source-workshop-chaosscon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-introduction"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2025-eu"&gt;CHAOSScon Europe 2025&lt;/a&gt;, co-located with &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2025"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;, took place in Brussels, Belgium, on January 30, 2025. As part of the conference, &lt;a href="https://curioss.org"&gt;CURIOSS&lt;/a&gt; sponsored and facilitated a dedicated discussion on academic open source. The workshop brought together researchers, software developers, and open source advocates to discuss the challenges and opportunities of sustaining open source software in academia. With 12 participants in attendance, the discussions were divided into two sessions. The first session focused on understanding different types of research software, their sustainability, and institutional support. The second session expanded on these topics, addressing funding uncertainties, emergency open sourcing, and legal considerations related to intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Academic-Industry Collaboration</title><link>https://curioss.org/news/nov24-industry-partnerships/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://curioss.org/news/nov24-industry-partnerships/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="how-ospos-support-academic-industry-partnerships"&gt;How OSPOs Support Academic-Industry Partnerships&lt;/h1&gt;
